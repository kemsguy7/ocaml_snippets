  (*or better *)

  (*DEEP PATTERN MATCHING*)
  (*Patterns can be nested. Doing so can allow you code to look deeply into the structure of a list, for example â€¨_ :: []   =>  matches all lists with exactly one element  
  _ :: _   => matches all lists with at least one element .   
 _::_:: [] => matches all lists with exactly 2 elements
 _::_::_::_ => matches all lists with at least 3 elements
